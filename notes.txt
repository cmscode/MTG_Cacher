looks like this is in good shape. 09/30
good OO org and integration with Magick API
saved lots of pickle files and great system to open up and work with them.

next step if so desired would be to maybe build a deck with what's in the other decks,
but that's not super important right now.

what i was nicely surprised by today was that when i opened this up i saw how nicely it was done. i
can check the git logs and see when i worked on this.

other notes.

good to have a py project online but i honestly like having this local.
that's just a separate architechtural issue that is good to have something to test with.

i'd have to scope what i wanted to do with this, the short answer is nothing really right now.
i know i have a preponderance for just working with data in an organized fashion, but never really
'doing' anything with it.

i suppose i'd have to look at this and determine if there's anything else i'd like to do with it.
i'm just happy it works as well as it does, and it can find stuff in the pickled files so quickly!

SchaWheata!

10/22 notes

deck creator. interactive, pull from decks, specify colors creature types, etc. 
algorithm can get tough quick! but worth playing around with!
